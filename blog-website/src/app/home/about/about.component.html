  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    Ever since I was a little kid I was interesting in everything related to
    computers.
  </p>
  <p>I started my professional carreer as an Accountant. Working with numbers seems to be okay for me.</p>
  <p>After working in the field for about 1 year, I quickly realised that this was not what I wanted to do for my entire life.</p>
  <p>At that moment I started thinking, what am I enjoying most in life. And that's the moment I dropped out of school and signed up for an education in IT.</p>
  <p>
    Three years later I set up Gryphonheart Studios together with 4 of my class mates.
    We were going to make games together because we were very passionate about games at that point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, after 1,5 years of hard word on our new game, we came to the hard realisation that creating games is a very costly affair and the future for Gryphonheart did not look that bright.
    Thus after mutual understanding we all went our ways and decided to go into Software Engineering instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    There I found the complexity of creating tailor-made solutions for customers with very specific needs.
    This was challenging in its own way, which made me want to explore more of the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I'm working for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infosupport.com/en">Info Support</a> where I am a Medior Software Consultant.
    Aside from being a software consultant, I can be found in our knowledge center where I teach new and upcoming IT professionals in .NET and Angular.
